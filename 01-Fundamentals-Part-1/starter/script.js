//NOTES:

/*1. Variables should only contain letters, numbers, underscores and dollar sign.
2. Variables should never start with a number.
3. For naming convention, variables should always start with smallcase. Uppercase is for OOP's. 
4. All letters in uppercase are for constants.
5. There are variables that cannot be used because they are reserved like 'function'. Meaning, they are used by JS for a certain purpose.
6. JS uses camelCase. 
7. The word 'name' can be used but discouraged. Use some other term like 'firstName', etc.. */
